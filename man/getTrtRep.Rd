\title{
Calculate the Treatment Replication number
}
\description{
Calculate the replication number of every treatment term including the interaction. This is used to compute the treatment efficiency factors.
}
\usage{
getTrtRep(design.df, trtTerm)
}
\arguments{
   \item{design.df}{
a data frame containing the experimental design. Requires every column be a \code{\link{factor}}.
}
  \item{trtTerm}{
a vector of character containing the labels of the treatment terms in the model generated by the \code{\link{terms}}.
}
}
\value{
A list containing two objects. The first object is a matrix called \code{Rep} which contains the replication numbers, where the rows correspond to each treatment combination and the columns correspond to the treatment factors, i.e. the replication number with respect to each treatment factor based on the treatment combination. The second object called \code{Sca} which is a numeric vector for computing a coefficients of the fixed effect parameter in EMS.
