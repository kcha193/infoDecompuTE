\usage{
summaryAovOnePhase(design.df, blk.str, trt.str, var.comp = NA,
  trt.contr = NA, table.legend = FALSE, response = NA, latex = FALSE,
  fixed.names = NA, decimal = FALSE, digits = 2, list.sep = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{design.df}{a data frame containing the experimental design. Requires
every column be a \code{\link{factor}. Any punctuation or symbol such as
dots or parentheses should be avoid for the column names.}.}

\item{blk.str}{a single string of characters containing the structural
formula for the block factors using the Wilkinson-Rogers' syntax.}

\item{trt.str}{a single string of characters containing the structural
formula for the treatment factors using the Wilkinson-Rogers' syntax.}

\item{var.comp}{a vector of characters containing the variance components
of interest this allows the user to specify the variance components to be
shown on the ANOVA table. This also allows the user to specify artificial
stratum to facilitate decomposition. Default is \code{NA}, which uses every
random factor as the variance components from \code{random.terms}.}

\item{trt.contr}{a list of treatment contrast vectors, this allows the user
to specify the contrasts for each treatment factor. Note that if this
argument is used, it is necessary to specify the contrasts for every
treatment factor with the same order as \code{fixed.terms}. Default is
\code{NA}, which uses the C matrix described by John and Williams (1987).}

\item{table.legend}{a logical allows the users to use the legend for the
variance components of the ANOVA table for a large design. Default is
\code{FALSE}, which uses the original names.}

\item{response}{a numeric vector contains the responses from the
experiment.}

\item{latex}{a logical allows the users to output the Latex script to Latex
table. Once the Latex script is generated, it requires the user to install
and load two Latex packages: \code{booktabs} and \code{bm} to compile the
Latex script.}

\item{fixed.names}{a vector of character allows the users to modify symbols
for the fixed effects for the Latex outputs.}

\item{decimal}{a logical allows users to display the coefficients as the
decimals. Default is \code{FALSE}, resulting in the use of function
\code{fractions}.}

\item{digits}{a integer indicating the number of decimal places. Default is
2, resulting in 2 decimal places.}

\item{list.sep}{a logical allows users to present the efficiency factors
and coefficients of the fixed effects a list of seperate matrices. Default
is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
The values returned depends on the value of the \code{table.legend}
argument. If \code{table.legend = FALSE}, this function will return a list
of two data frames. The first data frame contains the random effects and
the second data frame contains the fixed effects. If the
\code{table.legend} argument is \code{TRUE}, then it will return a list
containing two lists. The first list consists of a data frame of random
effects and a character string for the legend. The second list consists of
a data frame of fixed effects and a character string for the legend.  If
\code{response} argument is used, the random effect table will have one
extra column with of mean squares computed from the responses from the
experiment.
}
\description{
Computes the coefficients of the variance components for the expected mean
squares for single-phase experiments. The function accepts a data frame of
the experimental design with the structural formulae of the block and
treatment factors. Two tables containing the variance components of the
random effects and fixed effects are returned.
