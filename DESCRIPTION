Description: This package 'InfoDecompuTE' is capable of generating the structure of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) table
              of the two-phase experiments. By inputting the design and the relationships of the random and 
              fixed factors using the Wilkinson-Rogers' syntax, 'infoDecompuTE' can generate the structure of 
              the ANOVA table with the coefficients of the variance components for the expected mean squares.
              This package can also study the balanced incomplete block design and provides the efficiency
              factors of the fixed effects.
